# Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction
Prediction of Airline Passenger Satisfaction for ML mini project in coursework
## Models
* Logistic Regression
* Naive Bayes
* KNN
* Decision Tree
## Conclusion
KNN has achieved the highest accuracy among the models, but it comes at the cost of significantly higher execution time. On the other hand, Decision Tree, while having slightly lower accuracy, is notably faster in terms of execution time. Therefore, considering the trade-off between accuracy and time, Decision Tree may be a more efficient choice for this particular scenario.
